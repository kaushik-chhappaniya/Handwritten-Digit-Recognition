# **Diagnostically Predict the Digit from the Handwritten Image Using ML Algorithms**

### Author: Kaushik Chhappaniya

## Problem Statement :

>   The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict the digit from the handwritten image which is in the Gray scale format. To predict what the digit is from 0 to 9 range. The dataset provided here is in the form of a CSV file (Comma Separated Values file). The CSV file i.e, the dataset consists of the values of the pixels in which the digit is printed. Each image is of the size 28*28 pixel. Total number of digits is 42000 (i.e, 0 to 41999). 


## Libraries Used :

- Pandas

- Numpy 

- Sklearn

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

## Algorithms Used :

    - Linear Kernel in SVC (Accuracy - 91.73%)

    - RBF Kernel in SVC (Accuracy - 95.78%)

## Steps :

1. Attach your dataset to the `.ipynb` file.

2. Directly run the given `.ipynb` script.
