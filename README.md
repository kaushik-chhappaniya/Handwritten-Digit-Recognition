***___ Detection of handwritten digits with the help of Machine learning algorithms ___***
	
	The project diagnostically predicts the digit from the handwritten image which is in the Grayscale format.
 	The machine learning algorithm used for the same gives an optimum accuracy of 95.75%. 

Steps:-
Directly Run the ML_Digit_Recognition.ipynb
